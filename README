These are my dotfiles. They contain the configuration of my multiple machines.

The repository is organized in packs, which are meant to be symlinked using GNU
stow into the home directory. Each pack contains a subset of dotfiles and
multiple packs may be stowed as an overlay.

The online backup is hosted at https://git.danirod.es/dotfiles/dotfiles. There
is a GitHub mirror, but it is read only. Please, do not send GitHub pull
requests. They cannot be accepted due to a GDPR policy and they will be closed
automatically.
